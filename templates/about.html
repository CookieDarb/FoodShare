        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>FoodShare was created with the aim of reducing food waste while helping those in need. Our platform connects restaurants with surplus food to NGOs and charities that can distribute the food to underserved communities. By bridging this gap, we ensure that excess food is used efficiently to fight hunger, rather than going to waste. The idea behind FoodShare is rooted in the belief that every meal matters, and no food should be discarded when it can provide hope to someone else. Our goal is to create a sustainable system that benefits both businesses and communities in need.</p>
        <p>Our mission is simple: to make food donation easy, accessible, and impactful. Through FoodShare, we want to encourage restaurants and organizations to work together in creating a world where food is no longer wasted, but instead, used to its fullest potential. With every donation, we bring hope to the people who need it most and contribute to a brighter, more equitable future.</p>
